# Variable choice

Color_blind not included

ON_run not included

off_run not included

Start_time not included: increase flexibility of the model but may capture too much noise due to $\epsilon^2$. i.e. it's obvious effect of starttime is correlated with **MEQ**, since we do not measure **MEQ**

video_games not included: no obvious differences between two groups

On_time

Off_time

we are interested in change between these two value, ie ratio, difference. Not the value themselves
